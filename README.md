# What is ytopt?
``ytopt`` is a machine-learning-based search software package that consists of sampling a small number of input parameter configurations, evaluating them, and progressively fitting a surrogate model over the input-output space until exhausting the user-defined time or the maximum number of evaluations. The package is built based on Bayesian Optimization that solves any optimization problem and is especially useful when the objective function is difficult to evaluate. It provides an interface that deals with unconstrained and constrained problems. The software is designed to operate in the manager-worker computational paradigm, where one manager node fits the surrogate model and generates promising input configurations and worker nodes perform the computationally expensive evaluations and return the outputs to the manager node. The asynchronous aspect of the search allows the search to avoid waiting for all the evaluation results before proceeding to the next iteration. As soon as an evaluation is finished, the data is used to retrain the surrogate model, which is then used to bias the search toward the promising configurations.

# Install instructions
The autotuning framework requires the following components: ConfigSpace, scikit-optimize, autotune, and ytopt. 

* We recommend creating isolated Python environments on your local machine usingÂ [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), for example:

```
conda create --name ytune python=3.7
conda activate ytune
```

* Create a directory for ytopt tutorial as follows:
```
mkdir ytopt
cd ytopt
```

* Install [ConfigSpace](https://github.com/deephyper/ConfigSpace.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/deephyper/ConfigSpace.git configspace
cd configspace
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

* Install [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/deephyper/scikit-optimize.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/deephyper/scikit-optimize.git
cd scikit-optimize
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

* Install [autotune](https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git):
```
git clone -b version1 https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git
cd autotune
pip install -e . 
cd ..
```

* Install [ytopt](https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt.git):
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt.git
cd ytopt
pip install -e .
```

If you encounter installtion error, install psutil, setproctitle, mpich, mpi4py first as follows:
```
conda install -c conda-forge psutil
conda install -c conda-forge setproctitle
conda install -c conda-forge mpich
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py
pip install -e .
```
